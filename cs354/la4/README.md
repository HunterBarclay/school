# Language Assignment 4: Golang

## Deliverables
Using the util command, you can build and run both the go and java project. The go project
was originally made to match it's java counterpart one for one, but now has a modified accrue
method that makes use of go routines and prints out the amount that has accrued.

To run the java project, use the following commands:
```bash
$ ./util java build
$ ./util java run
```

To run the go project, use the following commands:
```bash
$ ./util go build
$ ./util go run
```
