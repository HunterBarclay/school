# Language Assignment #1: Scheme

- Author: Hunter Barclay
- Course: CS354 - James Buffenbarger
- Date: Aug. 28th, 2024

## Deliverables

- `super-duper.scm`: Scheme file containing the `super-duper` function, along with helper functions.
- `test.scm`: Testing file to test the outputs of `super-duper` against expected results, printing data out to the console for feedback.
- `README.md`: This file

## Testing

Only `test.scm` is executable. You can either run the script with guile, or execute it like a normal executable:

```bash
$ guile test.scm
```

```bash
$ ./test.scm
```

In `test.scm`, all examples in the assignment instructions are tested and confirmed. In addition, I added another, larger test.

## General Usage

You can load the `super-duper.scm` script and use the function yourself, just as is done in `test.scm`.
